	<answer question="version">
Several versions of Emacs are available on Athena. GNU Emacs 21 (version 21.1.1) is the default version as of Athena 9.1. If you login to an older Athena 9.0 workstation, the default Emacs will be GNU Emacs 20 (version 20.7) Other versions of GNU Emacs are often available in the emacs locker.
Additionally, there is another version of emacs, XEmacs available on Athena. It traditionally has had a nicer X interface, and also a different set of lisp. To run it, use the commands:
add xemacs
xemacs &amp;

	<answer question="window size">
There are several ways to choose the size of your Emacs window.
If you start Emacs by just typing:
emacs &amp;
and you are using mwm (the default window manager), you use the mouse or keyboard to choose the window's placement, and then use the keyboard to select the size.  The mouse pointer will change to an inverted "L" with a rectangle attached to it, and a little box will pop up in the middle of the screen telling you the position of the L, and the current size of the window, something like this:
(120,115)
80x24
Move the mouse pointer to where you want the upper-left corner of the new window to be.  Now, you can either hit the left mouse button or return to place the window, if that's the size you want.  You can also hit the space bar, which will freeze the upper left corner, and any motion you make with the mouse will change the size of the rectangle. After you select the size you want, hit Return or the left mouse button, and the window will appear.
Note: If your workstation's mouse only has two buttons, pressing both buttons simultaneously has the same effect as pressing the middle button.
If you want, you can specify the window's size by providing a "geometry specification".  For example, if you type:
emacs -geometry 132x48 &amp;
...and press the left mouse button, the Emacs window will be 132 columns wide and 48 rows high.
You can also specify the position of the window relative to the upper-left corner of the screen.  For example:
emacs -geometry 132x48+50+100 &amp;
...will create your Emacs window with its upper-left corner located 50 pixels across from the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top of the screen.  In this case, the window appears automatically (you don't need to press any mouse buttons).
You can also resize the window after placing it: see the stock answer `How to MOVE or resize windows' under the XWINDOWS topic in the olc_answers program.

	<answer question="mouse buttons">
You can use your workstation's mouse to perform some editing operations in Emacs.  The table below summarizes these operations.

Button*:  Operation
Left:  Move the cursor to the mouse's location.

Middle:	Insert the text from the X cut buffer at the location of the Emacs cursor.

Right:  Copy the text between the cursor and the mouse into the X cut buffer.  The text is not deleted from the buffer but is put into the Emacs kill ring.  The text may be recalled by using MIDDLE (above) or Ctrl-Y.

Ctrl-Middle:  Cut the text between the cursor and the mouse into the X cut buffer.  The text is deleted from the buffer and is put into the Emacs kill ring.  The text may be recalled by using MIDDLE (above) or Ctrl-Y.

Ctrl-Right:  Divide the current window into two windows.

Ctrl-Shift-Right:  Return to single-window mode, keeping the window that contains the mouse.

Ctrl-Shift-Middle:  Brings up a pop-up help window, from which various operations or buffers may be selected with the mouse.

* Note: If your workstation's mouse only has two buttons, pressing both buttons simultaneously has the same effect as pressing the middle button.

	<answer question="moving the cursor">
If you're logged into a workstation, you can use the arrow keys (though not the numeric keypad arrows) to move the cursor around your window.  Additionally, emacs has another set of control characters for movement: 

To move forward one character, type:    CTRL-f
To move backward one character, type:   CTRL-b

To move to the next line, type:         CTRL-n
To move to the previous line, type:     CTRL-p

To move to the end of a line:           CTRL-e
To move to the beginning of a line:     CTRL-a

There are also some useful commands that use the Meta key.  On Suns, this is bound to both the Alt key and the diamond-symbol keys; on SGIs, it is bound to the Alt keys.   Additionally, the ESC key can be used in place of Alt/Meta.   

(Note that you must hold down Alt and then press the next key; ESC can  be pressed and released before hitting the next key).

To move forward one word:	                ESC f   or   M-f
To move backwards one word:	                ESC b   or   M-b
To move to the end of a sentence:	        ESC e   or   M-e
To move to the beginning of a sentence:		ESC a   or   M-a
To move to the end of the buffer:		ESC >	or   M->
To move to the beginning of the buffer:		ESC <	or   M-<

Notice how most of the commands are mnemonic.
